# BasicJSPPage
I made simple basic page of student information by using jsp, mysql, apache tomcat, html and css.

In that I am used Apache tomcat v9.0.
as well used Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers - 2020-09 to build page.

In mysql I am created database named as ``student`` with table name ``stud`` and entities as ``rn``, ``name`` and ``city``.
